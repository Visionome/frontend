# Visionome Frontend

Visionome is a play on Vision and genome. It it our teams hope to advance interests in bioinformatics in young students, specifically high schoolers and hope they consider bioinformatics as a possible career path. Our team is comprised of:
- Joey Giordano
- Dylan Skelly
- Arjun Pherwani
- Suneet Tipirneni
- Michael Tsang


We are all final year Computer Science students at the University of Central Florida. Our project mentor is Dr. Shibu Yooseph. We're using React on the frontend as well as AWS Amplify on the backend.
